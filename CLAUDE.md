# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

kubectl plugin (`kubectl rhaii-validate`) for validating GPU cluster readiness for AI/ML workloads. Runs hardware and network checks on GPU nodes via privileged Kubernetes Jobs. Auto-detects GPU vendor (NVIDIA/AMD), platform (AKS/EKS/CoreWeave/OCP), and cluster topology.

Binary: `rhaii-validator`. kubectl plugin name: `kubectl-rhaii_validate`.

**Epic:** INFERENG-4707

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
make build              # CGO_ENABLED=0 go build → bin/rhaii-validator
make install            # Build + install as kubectl plugin to /usr/local/bin
make test               # go test ./... -v
make lint               # golangci-lint run ./...
make fmt                # go fmt ./...
make container          # Build validator container (Dockerfile.dev)
make container-rdma     # Build tools container (tools/Dockerfile.dev)
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test ./pkg/checks/rdma/ -run TestParseLoopbackBWOutput -v
```

## Architecture

### Two Execution Modes

The binary runs in two modes controlled by subcommands:

1. **Controller mode** (`gpu`, `network`, `rdma`, `all`, etc.): Runs on the user's machine. Creates K8s namespace, RBAC, deploys Jobs to GPU nodes, collects results from pod logs (JSON), prints report, cleans up. Orchestrated by `pkg/controller/controller.go`.

2. **Agent mode** (`run` — hidden subcommand): Runs inside per-node Job pods. Executes checks directly (nvidia-smi injected by GPU runtime, sysfs read via privileged mode), outputs JSON report to stdout (progress to stderr). The controller parses JSON from pod logs. Orchestrated by `pkg/runner/runner.go`.

### Key Interfaces

- **`checks.Check`** (`pkg/checks/check.go`): Per-node check. Returns `checks.Result` with Status (PASS/WARN/FAIL/SKIP). Implementations live in `pkg/checks/gpu/`, `pkg/checks/rdma/`, `pkg/checks/networking/`, `pkg/checks/crd/`, `pkg/checks/operator/`.

- **`jobrunner.Job`** (`pkg/jobrunner/job.go`): Multi-node test (iperf3, ib_write_bw, ibv_rc_pingpong). Produces server/client K8s Job specs, parses stdout into `JobResult`. Optional interfaces: `Configurable`, `ThresholdConfigurable`, `ImageConfigurable`, `NameSuffixable`.

### Controller Execution Flow (`controller.Run`)

1. Cleanup previous runs
2. Ensure namespace + RBAC (+ SCC on OpenShift)
3. Detect platform, create/load config ConfigMap — if the ConfigMap already exists it is used as-is and never overwritten; delete it to reset to platform defaults
4. Tier 1: CRD + operator health checks (API-only, no pods)
5. Discover GPU nodes (label-based, fallback to allocatable scan)
6. Deploy per-node GPU check Jobs (request all GPUs for nvidia-smi)
7. Deploy per-node RDMA node check Jobs (topology, devices, NIC status)
   - If flat PCIe topology detected (PairingNUMAAffinity): run intra-host BW probe (one Job per flat node) to find optimal GPU-NIC pairs via measured loopback bandwidth; replace pairing with `PairingBandwidthProbe`
8. Run pingmesh RDMA connectivity mesh (pairwise ibv_rc_pingpong); classifies each NIC pair as rail (same rail index) or xrail (different rail)
9. Run multi-node bandwidth jobs (ring/star topology via jobrunner); RDMA jobs expanded per GPU-NIC pair from topology — one `RDMABandwidthJob` per pair (PD) plus one `RDMAWEPJob` (whole-endpoint, if 2+ unique NICs)
10. Store JSON report in ConfigMap `rhaii-validate-report` with merging (preserves fields this run didn't produce), print, cleanup

### Two Job Types

| | Per-node Jobs | Multi-node Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| Image | validator (rhaii-validator binary) | tools (iperf3/RDMA) or validator (tcp-lat) |
| GPU request | All GPUs (for nvidia-smi visibility) | 1 per pod |
| Host access | privileged (host sysfs visibility) | None |
| Framework | `pkg/runner` | `pkg/jobrunner` (ring/star/pairwise scheduling) |

### Container Images

Two images, resolved from `manifests/image-references/image-references.yaml` (embedded via `//go:embed` in `manifests/image-references/embed.go`):
- **Validator** (`RELATED_IMAGE_RHAII_CLUSTER_VALIDATOR`): This binary. Used for per-node checks and TCP latency.
- **Tools** (`RELATED_IMAGE_RHAII_VALIDATOR_TOOLS`): iperf3, ib_write_bw, ibv_rc_pingpong for network/RDMA jobs.

Override with env vars or CLI flags (`--image`, `--tools-image`).

### Platform Config

Embedded per-platform YAML in `pkg/config/platforms/`. Only configurable values — everything else is auto-detected. Loaded at startup, can be overridden via ConfigMap (`rhaii-validate-config`) in the cluster. Key configurable fields: `gpu.min_driver_version`, `jobs.requests/limits` (including RDMA resources), `thresholds.*`, `jobs.rdma_type`.

### Embedded Manifests

- `deploy/embed.go` embeds `deploy/node-check-job.yaml` (per-node Job template) and `deploy/rbac.yaml` (ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding) as byte slices. The controller clones the Job template and mutates per-node fields before creating; RBAC resources are applied from the embedded YAML each run.

### Report Storage

JSON report stored in ConfigMap `rhaii-validate-report`. Supports report merging: runs that don't produce certain sections (e.g., `rdma-ping` doesn't produce Nodes) preserve data from previous runs. Pingmesh failures go to a separate ConfigMap `rhaii-validate-pingmesh-failures` (deleted on full pass).

## CLI Subcommands

```
gpu              GPU hardware checks (driver, ECC)
network          TCP bandwidth + latency (iperf3, tcp-lat)
rdma             All RDMA: rdma-node + rdma-ping + rdma-bandwidth
rdma-node        Per-node RDMA checks (devices, status, topology)
rdma-ping        RDMA connectivity mesh (ibv_rc_pingpong); requires prior rdma-node run
rdma-bandwidth   RDMA bandwidth (ib_write_bw); requires prior rdma-node run
all              Everything (deps + gpu + network + rdma)
deps             CRDs + operator health (no pods deployed)
clean            Remove validation resources
run              (hidden) Agent mode for per-node Jobs
```

Common flags: `--debug` (keep pods alive for `kubectl exec`/logs), `-o json`, `--image`, `--tools-image`, `--namespace`, `--nodes`, `--server-node`, `--pull-secret`.

## RPM Lockfiles (Konflux Hermetic Builds)

Konflux builds use [rpm-lockfile-prototype](https://github.com/konflux-ci/rpm-lockfile-prototype) to prefetch RPMs for hermetic builds. Three lockfile sets cover the two container images:

| Lockfile directory | Image | Stage | Repo source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rpms.in.yaml` (root) | cluster-validation | runtime (UBI9) | `rpm-repos/ubi.repo` |
| `tools/rpms.in.yaml` | validator-tools | runtime (UBI9) | `rpm-repos/ubi.repo` |
| `tools/builder/rpms.in.yaml` | validator-tools | builder (CUDA) | `rpm-repos/redhat.repo` |

The builder and runtime stages are split because the CUDA base image has older packages than UBI9 — resolving both against a single base image causes version conflicts.

**Adding a new RPM package:**

1. Add the package to the relevant `dnf install` in the Dockerfile
2. Add the package to the matching `rpms.in.yaml` (check which stage installs it)
3. Regenerate the lockfile:
   ```bash
   # Root (cluster-validation runtime)
   rpm-lockfile-prototype --outfile rpms.lock.yaml rpms.in.yaml

   # Tools runtime
   rpm-lockfile-prototype --outfile tools/rpms.lock.yaml tools/rpms.in.yaml

   # Tools builder (requires RHEL entitlement certs on the host)
   rpm-lockfile-prototype --outfile tools/builder/rpms.lock.yaml tools/builder/rpms.in.yaml
   ```
4. Commit both the `rpms.in.yaml` and `rpms.lock.yaml` changes

**Repo files:**
- `rpm-repos/ubi.repo` — UBI9 repos (public, no auth). Section headers use `ubi-9-for-$basearch-*` naming to match Conforma's allowed repo ID list.
- `rpm-repos/redhat.repo` — RHEL 9.6 EUS repos (requires entitlement certs). The cert paths in the file are placeholders — Konflux mounts real certs at build time via activation key.

**MintMaker** automatically opens PRs to refresh lockfiles on release branches. On `main`, regenerate manually when adding/updating packages.

## Coding Conventions

- Per-node checks implement `checks.Check`; multi-node tests implement `jobrunner.Job`
- GPU tools (nvidia-smi, rocm-smi) are injected by GPU container runtime via resource requests; RDMA tools (ibv_devices, ibstat) and sysfs reads use privileged mode's host visibility
- Use `apierrors.IsNotFound()` for K8s errors, never string matching
- Deploy manifests embedded via `//go:embed` (not read from filesystem)
- `run` subcommand is hidden and internal — only used by per-node Job pods
- Agent JSON report goes to stdout, progress to stderr — container runtimes merge both in `kubectl logs`, so the controller skips lines until it finds `{`
- RDMA bandwidth jobs are expanded per GPU-NIC pair from topology (not one job per node); WEP job added if 2+ unique NICs
- Pingmesh uses N-choose-2 pairwise scheduling with round-robin tournament and 3 controller-managed retries; rail vs xrail classification based on pair position index in each node's topology
- GPU vendor is always auto-detected (never configured)
- RDMA resource (e.g., `rdma/ib`, `nvidia.com/roce`) must be manually configured in platform config

## Known Limitations

- AMD GPUs: bandwidth jobs skipped (tools image is NVIDIA-only)
- `ibv_devices`/`ibstat` not on AKS hosts — sysfs fallback used
- NCCL all-reduce job: framework ready, needs NCCL image
- `deps` subcommand: partially implemented (CRDs + operators)
